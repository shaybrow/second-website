        <h2>Long Story Short</h2>
        <p id="blurb">My name is Seamus Brown and I'm a 25 year old guy
            (he/him) born and raised in Kirkland, WA. Most of my friends call me Shay but I don't mind either way. My
            family is originally from Canada but moved to the states before I was born. When I was 18 I moved to
            Bellingham and consider it my home town. I love the small town vibe and
            being surrounded by nature. During my spare time you can probably find me disk golfing, reading a book or
            spending time with my friends.</p>

        <h2>Goals, Hopes and Dreams</h2>

        <div>My current goal is to attain a fulfilling job with freedom of mobility. To me that means regularly meeting
            and overcoming challenges. I'd love to spend a year or two traveling while I meet those challenges.
